	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		My name is Christian Hodgden. I am currently a Data Analyst for an Industrial Engineering department in a distribution environment. 
		I am learning about other programming languages and am very interested in Data Science. I have professionially done some linear regression modeling within our team and I would like to expand that part of my career. 
		Learing about Machine Learning and other techniques is very interesting and I would like to find applications for the Neural Network library I have build in R. I will likely develop one for Python and well when I get to it.
		<br>
		Right now I am self teching on YouTube tutorials and taking certifications as I can. I am eyeing the Advanced Data Analytics course by Google as a potential next step.
