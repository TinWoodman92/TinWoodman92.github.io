	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		My name is Christian Hodgden.
		I am currently a Data Analyst for an Industrial Engineering department in a distribution environment. 
		I am learning about other programming languages and very interested in Data Science. 
		I have professionially done some linear regression modeling within our team and I would like to expand that part of my career. 
		Learing about Machine Learning and other techniques is very interesting.
		<br>
		<br>
		Right now I am teaching myself with YouTube tutorials and taking certifications as I can.
