	<p>
		As I was learning python, I made a very simple inteactive tic tac toe game. 
		I kept polishing it instead of progressing through the tutorial I was in.
		In pushing myself to add and debug features I found that I got to a point where I could teach myself by referencing Python's own documentation.
	</p>
	<a href="./presentation_code/tictactoe.md" target="_blank">Simple version</a>
	<p>
		This version will work on all platformas that run Python.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got this version complete, I continued with other tutorials to learn about object oriented programming and other Python libraries.
	</p>
	<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
	<p>
		This was a simple and fun project for me to learn python. 
		Not all the menu items have been set up and will crash if they are selected. 
		The keyboard interface only works with Microsoft Windows OS.
	</p>
	<p>
		It does not apply proper machine learning techniques. 
		The "machine learning" is aggregating in raw SQL for each occurance. 
		They do infact improve and figure out how to play.
	</p>

	<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
	<p>
		Next steps for this project will be to integrate proper machine learning into the the AI profiles. 
		Then add the rest of the menu elements. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I may decide to do this in JavaScript and HTML with the Math.js or TensorFlow libraries. 
		The potential for this project is educational. 
		It would be nice to share easily and be more interactive.
