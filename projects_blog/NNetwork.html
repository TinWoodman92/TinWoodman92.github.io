	<p>
		After learning R from a few R tutorials, I decided it was time to learn what machine learning and data science truly was.
		I had been putting off looking those up because I didn't feel like I was ready.
		I watched a series on neural networks by 3Blue1Brown on YouTube linked below.
	</p>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk" target="_blank">
		But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning
	</a>
	<p>
		<i>"Oh, I can do that."</i> I immediately thought to myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		This video series applied old and familiar concepts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus that I had learned in college.
		Knowing that there were applications of this with data and programming inspired me to try to write some libraries from scratch.

	<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
	<p>
		I chose R to do this rather than Python because I wanted to build experience with R. 
		This project would be a good demonstration of mixing higher mathmatics with programming, which is what R was built to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did not follow any programming tutorials when developing this. 
		My primary intention was to familiarize myself with the math behind these concepts. 
		I wrote out as much of the program that made sense to me and then referenced YouTube for more detailed topics as I came to them.
		I primariliy referenced a series by deeplizard on Neural Networks linked below.

		Deep Learning Fundamentals - Intro to Neural Networks
	</a>
	<p>
		This series was helpful and taught me about weights and bias initialization, the learning rate, and walked the tedious math sequences in a way that I could follow with my code.
	</p>
	<p>
		One idea I came up with myself was simple testing process to verify the project worked.
		I decided to test the network by training it to read binary.
		This way I would not have to find or build a database of training data, nor label the data.
	</p>
	<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
	<p>
		This project was written in December of 2022 and added to GitHub in February of 2023. 
		The next seps I would like to do would be to formalize the testing process into a Unit Test with the testthat library in R.
		After that, I would like to format the library into a package that could be installed consistently into other machines.
		Not necesarrily through CRAN, but through GitHub.
